# Non numerical tests

In this file I will implement a series of tests that will basically check that the plots of the quantities I am interested in are correct.

This file is not a proper set of test, but rather a qualitative check of the results.

I will check the auxiliary functions, the control function, the Hamiltonian of the system and finally the fidelity.
=#
#=
# 1 - Auxiliary functions

Here I need to check that the auxiliary functions work as expected.
I will plot a series of auxiliary functions for different final times to see how they look.
=#

using Plots, EBJJ

#=
# 3 - Hamiltonian 

I have to figure out how to check if the Hamiltonian is correct.
I think I am on the right track because the fidelity seems to consistently go to 1 for longer final times and drop for shorter times.
=#

#=
# 4 - Fidelity

I will define a new function that evaluates both the corrections and the corresponding fidelity internally.
I will lay out everything inside the body of the function, hoping that I can get some nice result
